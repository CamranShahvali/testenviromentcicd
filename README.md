- Type-safe communication between frontend and backend using gRPC/connect
- Real-time data updates

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - React with TypeScript
  - Vite for fast development
  - Buf for compiling protocol buffers
  - Connect for communication

- **Rust gRPC Backend**:

  - Rust
  - Tonic for gRPC implementation
  - In-memory storage (can be extended to use a database)

- **Go Connect Backend**:

  - Go
  - Buf for compiling protocol buffers
  - Connect for gRPC implementation
  - In-memory storage (can be extended to use a database)

- **Shared**:
  - Protocol Buffers for type definitions
